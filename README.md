# Syllabi Supply
A collection of University of Toronto course syllabi for students to look at before they enroll in a course.  
We are always looking for more syllabi, please consider [contributing](https://www.dropbox.com/request/KoYQZNyT43EJxBvRPc4P) if you have any.

## Motivation
When I was choosing courses I would always want to see the syllabus before I actually enrolled, but the University of Toronto didn't have a collection of course syllabi. I would have to resort to e-mailing professors (who didn't reply) or asking friends (who wouldn't always have the syllabi). I decided to make my own collection with the help of other students and Syllabi Supply was created!

## Note
The design of the website is based heavily off of the design of [Intern.Supply](http://www.intern.supply/), a website that helps students find internships.

## Disclaimer
Courses and professors change from year to year so please keep that in mind when browsing the syllabi. There is no guarantee that the current years content / mark breakdown / assignments / **textbook** / ect. will be the same as previous years.
